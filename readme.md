# Besiege Creation Import Addon for Blender

This is an addon for Blender to import Besiege Creations. All models are imported from the Besiege game data directory and steam workshop folder, so you will need to have a copy of the game from Steam.

**Note:** For development, use the latest version of [fake-bpy-module collection](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module) 

### Things that are not working
- Warped brace cubes
- Surface blocks
- Short wooden poles and blocks
